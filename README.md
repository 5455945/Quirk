Quantum Circuit Inspector
=========================

A visualization and experimentation tool for small quantum circuits. Includes common single-qubit gates, but not many multi-qubit gates (e.g. swap and fourier transform). Supports controlled and time-varying operations. Not much support for customization yet.

For example, here is a screenshot of a quantum teleportation circuit. The qubit in A1, which is entangled with B2, is teleported to B1:
